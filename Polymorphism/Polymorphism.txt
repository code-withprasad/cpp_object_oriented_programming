                           🔥 POLYMORPHISM IN C++ 🔥
=====================================================================

📌 Easy Understanding:
Polymorphism means "many forms".  
A single function, object, or operator can behave differently in different situations.

📌 Definition:
Polymorphism allows **one interface to be used for multiple forms**.

📌 Types:
1. Compile-time Polymorphism (Static)
    - Function Overloading
    - Operator Overloading
2. Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic)
    - Method Overriding (with virtual functions)

📌 Real-Life Example:
A person can have multiple roles:
    - Student
    - Employee
    - Teacher
The same "work()" function behaves differently depending on role.

📌 Why Use:
✔ Code Reusability
✔ Flexibility
✔ Clean and modular design
